# 📂 Automatic Folder Sorter

A simple Python script that automatically organizes files from a folder (like your Downloads folder) into categorized subfolders based on file types.  
I built this tool to keep my **Downloads** folder clean and structured without needing to manually sort files every day.

## ✨ Features

- Sorts files into categories like **Audio**, **Compressed**, **Documents**, **Images**, **Programs**, and **Videos**.
- Easy to configure: just update folder paths and file types in a single place.
- Lightweight — no external Python packages required.
- Helps maintain a neat and organized file system automatically.

## 🛠 How It Works

The script checks each file in the target folder, compares its extension against a pre-defined list, and moves it to the correct destination folder.

### Example Categories:
| Category   | Extensions |
|------------|------------|
| Audio      | `.mp3`, `.wav`, `.flac`, etc. |
| Compressed | `.zip`, `.rar`, `.7z`, etc. |
| Documents  | `.pdf`, `.docx`, `.txt`, etc. |
| Images     | `.jpg`, `.png`, `.gif`, `.svg`, etc. |
| Programs   | `.exe`, `.jar`, `.bat`, `.msi`, etc. |
| Videos     | `.mp4`, `.avi`, `.mov`, etc. |

*(You can customize or expand these easily.)*

## 📦 Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/automatic-folder-sorter.git
   ```
2. **Navigate into the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd automatic-folder-sorter
   ```

## ⚙️ Setup

1. **Edit the Script**:
   - Set the `folderToSort` variable to the folder you want to organize (e.g., your Downloads folder).
   - Update each `path` in the `sort_library` list to where you want the files to be moved.

Example:
```python
folderToSort = r"C:\Users\YourName\Downloads"

sort_library = [
    {
        "folder": "Documents",
        "path": r"C:\Users\YourName\Downloads\Documents",
        "extensions": [".pdf", ".docx", ".txt"],
    },
    # Other categories...
]
```

2. **Run the script**:
   ```bash
   python folder_sorter.py
   ```

That's it!  
All matching files will be moved into the appropriate folders.

## 📝 Customization

You can add more folders or file types by editing the `sort_library` list:

```python
{
    "folder": "Ebooks",
    "path": r"C:\Users\YourName\Downloads\Ebooks",
    "extensions": [".epub", ".mobi", ".azw3"],
}
```

Simply append new dictionaries with `folder`, `path`, and `extensions` to the `sort_library` list.

## 🙋‍♂️ Why I Built This

My Downloads folder was constantly a mess with documents, videos, programs, and random images piling up.  
I built this automatic folder sorter to **save time**, **reduce clutter**, and **improve my productivity** — no more manual file moving!
